This is a collaborative challenge we worked on together during our training at BeCode from 27.01.2021 to 29.01.2021.
The objective of this challenge is to create a csv file format with the data scraped from a real estate site.

With the use of BeautifulSoup and Selenium we have navigated through immoweb.be/en.
We scraped data from several individual houses.
The project is not yet finished. We still have to complete the automation of data scraping of individual houses and put these into a csv file.

    # We used 

-Mac OS and Windows OS  
-Anaconda versions 1.10.1(mac version) and 4.9.2  
-BeautifulSoup4 and Selenium libraries
